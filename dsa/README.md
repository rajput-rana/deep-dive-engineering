# Data Structures & Algorithms

This directory contains solutions to DSA problems organized by topic and difficulty level.

## Structure

Each topic folder (`arrays`, `strings`, `linked-list`, etc.) contains three subdirectories:
- `easy/` - Problems suitable for beginners
- `medium/` - Intermediate level problems
- `hard/` - Advanced problems requiring deep understanding

## Problem Format

Each problem solution should follow the template in `../templates/dsa-problem-template.md`:
- Problem statement
- Constraints
- Intuition
- Approach
- Complexity analysis
- Edge cases
- Clean code implementation

## Topics Covered

- **Arrays** - Array manipulation, two pointers, sliding window
- **Strings** - String processing, pattern matching
- **Linked List** - Single/double linked lists, cycles
- **Stacks & Queues** - LIFO/FIFO data structures
- **Trees** - Binary trees, BST, traversal algorithms
- **Graphs** - Graph algorithms, shortest paths, connectivity
- **Dynamic Programming** - Optimization problems, memoization
- **Greedy** - Greedy algorithms and optimization
- **Backtracking** - Recursive problem solving
- **Bit Manipulation** - Bitwise operations
- **Math** - Mathematical algorithms and number theory
