## Problem Statement

<!-- Problem description from LeetCode -->

**LeetCode Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-of-splitted-binary-tree/

## Constraints

<!-- Add constraints from LeetCode problem page -->

## Intuition

Use two pointers to traverse the array from both ends or at different speeds.

## Approach

Maintain two pointers and move them based on problem conditions.

### Algorithm
1. Initialize left and right pointers
2. While pointers haven't met
3. Process current elements
4. Move pointers based on condition
5. Return result

### Implementation Notes
- **Runtime:** 5 ms
- **Memory:** 59.4 MB
- **Tags:** N/A
- **Difficulty:** Medium

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

## Edge Cases

- Empty array
- Single element
- All elements same

## Solution Code

See the solution implementation in: [`maximum-product-of-splitted-binary-tree.java`](./maximum-product-of-splitted-binary-tree.java)

## Test Cases
