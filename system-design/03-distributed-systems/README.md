# Distributed Systems

Concepts and patterns for building distributed systems that work across multiple machines.

## Topics

- **[01. Consistent Hashing](./01-consistent-hashing.md)** - Distributed hashing algorithm
- **[02. Service Discovery](./02-service-discovery.md)** - Finding services in distributed systems
- **[03. Consensus Algorithms](./03-consensus-algorithms.md)** - Raft, Paxos
- **[15. CRDTs](./15-crdts.md)** - Conflict-free Replicated Data Types

## Key Concepts

- **Consensus:** Getting multiple nodes to agree
- **Consistency:** Ensuring data coherence
- **Partition Tolerance:** Handling network failures
- **Fault Tolerance:** Surviving node failures
