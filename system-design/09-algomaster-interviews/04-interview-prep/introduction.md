# Introduction to System Design Interviews

System design interviews are where companies test whether you can build software that survives the real world.
Not “can you write code,” but: can you design a service that stays fast when traffic spikes, keeps working when servers fail, stores data safely, and still feels simple to evolve six months later?
System design interviews are different from coding interviews. There's no single correct answer. No test cases to pass. Instead, you're evaluated on how you think about building large-scale systems.
In this chapter, I'll explain:
- What system design interviews are
- Why they exist
- What interviewers are actually looking for

Formally, system design is often divided into High-Level Design (HLD) and Low-Level Design (LLD).
In this course, we’ll focus on the HLD side of system design. If you also want to learn LLD, I have a separate [comprehensive course](https://algomaster.io/learn/lld/what-is-lld) that covers everything you need for LLD interviews.
If your goal is to learn system design fundamentals (and not specifically prepare for interviews), I recommend starting with my [System Design Fundamentals](https://algomaster.io/learn/system-design/what-is-system-design) course first.
# 1. What is a System Design Interview?
A system design interview is a technical interview where you're asked to design the architecture of a large-scale software system. Think "Design Instagram" or "Design a rate limiter."
In a coding round, you're given a well-defined problem with clear inputs, outputs, and constraints. You write code, run it against test cases, and either pass or fail. It's binary.
System design is messier. The problem is intentionally vague. The constraints are whatever you and the interviewer decide they should be. There's no code to run. Instead, you're drawing boxes and arrows on a whiteboard while explaining your thought process out loud.
These interviews typically last **45-60 minutes** and involve designing systems like:
- Social platforms (Twitter/X, Instagram)
- Messaging services (WhatsApp, Slack,)
- Streaming platforms (YouTube, Netflix)
- Marketplaces (Uber, Airbnb, DoorDash)
- Infrastructure (rate limiters, notification systems)

The goal is not to produce a production-ready design in 45 minutes. That's impossible. Real systems take teams of engineers months or years to build. 
The goal is to demonstrate that you can think through complex problems systematically, make reasonable trade-offs when there's no perfect answer, and communicate technical ideas in a way that others can follow and build upon.
# 2. Why Do Companies Conduct System Design Interviews?
Coding interviews answer one question: can this person write correct code? That's necessary, but it's not sufficient. Building software at scale requires a completely different set of skills.

### The Gap Between Code and Systems
Consider what happens when you write a function that works perfectly on your laptop. Now imagine that function needs to:
- Handle 10,000 requests per second instead of one
- Keep working when a database server crashes at 3 AM
- Return results in under 100 milliseconds, every time
- Store 10 years of data without running out of disk space

Suddenly, the algorithm isn't the hard part anymore. The hard part is everything around it: how data flows through the system, where bottlenecks will appear, what happens when things fail.
System design interviews exist to filter for engineers who can think beyond the function level.

### How Expectations Change with Seniority
The weight given to system design increases dramatically as you move up the ladder.
| Level | Coding Weight | System Design Weight |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Junior (L3) | High | Rarely asked |
| Mid-level (L4) | High | Light assessment |
| Senior (L5) | Medium | Required, must pass |
| Staff (L6) | Screening only | Heavy emphasis |
| Principal (L7+) | Often skipped | Primary focus |

This makes sense when you think about what each level does day-to-day. Junior engineers implement features that someone else designed. Senior engineers design those features.
Staff engineers design systems that span multiple teams. At each level, the scope of your design responsibility expands.

### What Companies Learn About You
System design interviews reveal more than whether you know the “right” architecture. They show how you think, how you make decisions, and how you communicate:
- **Technical breadth and depth:** Do you know when to use a message queue? Can you explain the trade-offs between SQL and NoSQL?
- **Problem decomposition:** Can you take a vague problem like "Design Instagram" and break it into concrete, solvable parts? This skill transfers directly to real engineering work.
- **Trade-off reasoning:** Every design decision has costs and benefits. It typically raises a red flag if you mention a technology (e.g., Redis) but unable to explain why it's the right choice, or what you're giving up.
- **Communication clarity:** In the real world, you'll spend lot of time explaining your designs to others. The interview tests whether you can make your thinking easy to follow.
- **Experience signals:** Practical judgment stand out. For example, a candidate who can justify eventual consistency because the product can tolerate a 10-second delay is showing the kind of judgment that comes from building real systems.

# 3. What Do Interviewers Look For?
System design interviews are subjective. Different interviewers value different things, and different problems call for different approaches. That said, most interviews still rely on a common set of evaluation criteria.

### 1. Requirements Gathering
The first few minutes of a system design interview reveal more than most candidates realize. When you get a problem like “Design a URL shortener,” you’re expected to pause and ask clarifying questions before you start drawing boxes and arrows.
For a URL shortener, a few high-signal clarifying questions are:
- "How many URLs are we shortening per day?"
- "What's the read-to-write ratio?"
- "Do short URLs expire, or are they permanent?"
- "Do we need analytics on click counts?"

### 2. High-Level Design
Once requirements are clear and you have identified the core entities/apis of the system, you can move on to the high-level design. The goal here is to sketch the major components of the system and how they interact.
A typical high-level design includes:
- **Entry points:** web/mobile clients, API gateway
- **Application layer:** services handling business logic
- **Data layer:** databases, caches, object/object storage
- **Async processing:** queues, workers, schedulers
- **Supporting infrastructure:** load balancers, CDN, monitoring/logging

The goal isn't to include every possible component. It's to include the right components for your specific requirements and be able to explain why each one is there.

### 3. Deep Dives
Once you’ve sketched the high-level design, the interviewer will usually zoom in on one or two components and ask you to go deeper.
**Common deep-dive areas include:**
- Database schema design and indexing
- Caching strategy, eviction, and invalidation
- Unique ID generation at scale
- Failure handling and data consistency
- Optimizing for specific access patterns and p99 latency
- Scaling for high availability (replication, sharding, multi-region)

### 4. Trade-off Analysis
Every design choice comes with a downside, and you are expected to recognize it.
If you say, “I'll use a NoSQL database”, the next question could be: “Why?” A weak answer is “because it scales.” A strong answer ties the choice to the requirements and names the trade-off.
“I'm choosing NoSQL because we need high write throughput and easy horizontal scaling. The trade-off is weaker consistency and more complexity around joins and transactions. That’s acceptable here because this feature can tolerate slightly stale reads.”

### 5. Communication
Technical knowledge matters, but how you communicate it matters just as much. A system design interview isn’t a quiz, it’s closer to a design discussion with a teammate. You're expected to explain your thinking in a way that's easy to follow.
Here are few signs of clear communication:
- Structured explanations (start with the big picture, then zoom in)
- Using diagrams effectively (not just boxes and arrows, but clear labels and data flow)
- Check in with the interviewer ("Does this make sense so far?")
- Adapt when given feedback ("Good point, let me reconsider that component")
