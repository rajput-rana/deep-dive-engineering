# Design Patterns

Common architectural patterns for building scalable and maintainable systems.

## Contents

- **[01. Microservices Architecture](./01-microservices-architecture.md)** - Service decomposition, communication patterns, tradeoffs, language selection, interview questions
- **[Monolithic Architecture](./monolithic-architecture.md)** - Single unified application, when to use, migration paths
- **[Peer-to-Peer Architecture](./peer-to-peer-architecture.md)** - Decentralized networks, DHT, use cases

## Patterns Covered

- Microservices vs Monolith tradeoffs
- Service communication (synchronous vs asynchronous)
- Decentralized architectures
- When to use each pattern
- Migration strategies

## Design Considerations

When choosing an architectural pattern:
1. Team size and structure
2. Application complexity
3. Scaling requirements
4. Technology needs
5. Operational capabilities
