# System Design

Comprehensive system design documentation and case studies.

## Structure

- **Fundamentals** - Core system design principles, scalability basics
- **Design Patterns** - Common architectural patterns (microservices, event-driven, etc.)
- **Tradeoffs** - Analysis of design decisions and their implications
- **Case Studies** - Detailed breakdowns of real-world system designs
- **Real-World Systems** - Deep dives into production systems

## Design Process

Follow the template in `../templates/system-design-template.md`:
1. Requirements gathering (functional & non-functional)
2. Capacity estimation
3. High-level design
4. Data model
5. API design
6. Scaling strategy
7. Tradeoffs analysis
8. Failure scenarios

## Focus Areas

- Scalability and performance
- Reliability and fault tolerance
- Consistency and availability tradeoffs
- Cost optimization
- Operational simplicity
